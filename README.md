You have three panels (for the Text Editor, VSE, and 3D Viewport) to display and insert Unicode characters.

Unicode characters are grouped by categories (e.g., symbols, emojis, Greek letters, animals, etc.), making it easier to browse and insert them.

Allows the insertion of a selected Unicode character into the active text editor, VSE text strip, or a 3D viewport text object.
